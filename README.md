# quotes
A database of quotes I like (for the Linux "fortune" program)

The repo contains various sets of quotes
- quotes about coffee from famous people
- quotes about development and tech by important people in the field of technology
- quotes about society from people that should know better

## build and deploy

Run `./build.sh` to recreate the .dat files

Run `sudo ./update.sh` to update the fortune database (you'll need to have `fortune` installed)
